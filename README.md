# Github Finder

## Overview

GitHub Finder is a React application that allows the user to search for GitHub profiles. When a profile is selected, the GitHub user's information is displayed, along with links to their latest repositories. This application started off implementing class base components and stateless functional components. After achieving the desired functionality of the application, the code was refactored into all-functional components using hooks, such as useState and useEffect. Finally, the code was refactored once again implementing app-level state using the Context API, the useReducer hook, and the useContext hook.
